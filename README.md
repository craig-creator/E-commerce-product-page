## Introduction
This small page was built while I was learning web development. I felt like there ahould be an easiest way to build web pages without writing CSS. That when I discovered some CSS frameworks then I decided to put in the work and build something with one of them.

## Technolgies
In this project I used:
-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-Bulma CSS

## Demo
Find this project hosted on [Sacoche](https://www.sacoche.netlify.app)

## Status
I may add some features as my knowledge in web development continues to expand.
